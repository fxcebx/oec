    <h1>{{ _('About the Observatory') }}</h1>
    <p>
      The Observatory of Economic Complexity is a tool that allows users to quickly compose a visual narrative about countries and the products they exchange. It was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/the-observatory-designing-data__driven-decision-making-tools/" alt="Download Alex Simoes' MIT Master's Thesis on Observatory of Economic Complexity">Alexander Simoes' Master Thesis</a> in Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was conducted at The MIT Media Lab <a target="_blank" href="http://macro.media.mit.edu/">Macro Connections</a> group (now Collective Learning). Alex’s Advisor was <a target="_blank" href="http://chidalgo.com">César A. Hidalgo</a>, principal investigator of Macro Connections. Since its creation in 2010, the development of The Observatory of Economic Complexity has been supported by The MIT Media Lab consortia for undirected research.
